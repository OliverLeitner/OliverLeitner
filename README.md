The pinned Repositories on my dashboard are projects which are or where in active use by other ppls as well as me.
To get a full list of all of my repositories, either click on the "Repositories" tab above, or follow this link:

<a href="https://github.com/OliverLeitner?tab=repositories" title="Full list of my demos and projects">My Demos / Projects</a>

- note about the demos: each demo has been done by me within 6-8 hours, those where experiments out of personal interest on how far i'd get in a common workday with things.
- note about the projects, scripts and tools: i am doing these for my personal use cases and put them onto github because i believe that they might be useful, at least as a starting point, to other peoples.

My work focus (so far):

- Web Development, mainly frontend but not limited to. Been doing it for years in everything that came along technology wise.

My stance on AI and using copilot and tools alike:

- None of my demos or code has been done using assisting technologies, that does not mean id never use them, it just means i had no reason to so far. I have been playing around with openai's chatgpt and a bit of copilot in the past and can see a place for them in assisting with getting things done faster. Then again, i love to learn new things and actually understand them.

Leitner is a relatively common name in austria, so...
